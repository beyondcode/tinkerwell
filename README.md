Tinkerwell is a REPL on steroids. It allows you to run code snippets within the context of your application without
hitting the browser. It's the perfect companion to your favorite IDE and works with any framework â€“ locally, via SSH,
Docker and even on Laravel Vapor.

This package contains helpful tools to customize Tinkerwell for your application.

**You do not need to install this package to customize Tinkerwell. Just copy the driver or tool you need into your
applications' [custom driver](https://tinkerwell.app/docs/3/extending-tinkerwell/custom-drivers). However, if you want
to make use of
autocompletion while implementing your customization, it's helpful to install this package as a dev dependency.**
```
composer require --dev beyondcode/tinkerwell
```
